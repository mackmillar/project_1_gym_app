How to run

Installations

The web app runs on a Flask framework and uses the psycopg2 library for database connections.

To install Flask: pip3 install flask

To install pyscopg2: pip3 install pyscopg2

Database

PostgreSQL was used in this project. SQL queries are included in the app (gym_app.sql) to create tables in the database.

To create a database and tables:

createdb gym_web_app
psql d- gym_web_app -f db/gym_app.sql
If you would like some data to start with, execute the following in the terminal within the app directory: python3 console.py
Run Web App

In the terminal, within the app folder, execute flask run to run the web app. When running, the app can be viewed in a browser on localhost:5000.
